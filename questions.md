Lesson 2

String Properties
- How do we tell the difference between a method and a property?<br> 
    I'm guessing the presence of ()?
- Does that distinction matter?
    - If the above is true, wouldn't length also be considered a method?<br> 
        Even though they have different names, they both produce a result.

Leading and Trailing Spaces
- What is meant by "multiple breakups"?

Part 3

Playground
- Is there a way to evaluate more than expression at a time (e.g. when we use the && operator in JS)?
    - You can evaluate more than one expression at a time with the && operation inside an if statement.
- Is there is a way to use the .Contains method to search multiple lines at a time?

Part 4 

Playground
- How are integers rounded?
    - I would have expected them to round down if the number immediately following the decimal point is less than 5 and round up if not. However, the above expression rounded down, and the below expression rounded up, so the opposite seems to be true.

Part 5

Doubles: Precision and Size
- What does "floating point" mean?
- What do they mean by doubles being able to "hold"?

Part 6

Working with Fixed Point Types
- What is meant by "fixed point types"?

Playground
- Why am I getting this error message when I try to use the integer or decimal type: "Cannot implicitly convert type 'double' to 'int'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)"?   
    - Math.PI holds a value that is a double type, so its result can't be assigned to a different number type; you'd have to convert it to that specific number type first for the expression to work
- What is a short number type?

Part 7 

Playground
- What is meant by "draw out the flow of an if statement"?
